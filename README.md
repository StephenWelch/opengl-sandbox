# OpenGL Sandbox

This is my workspace for learning both Modern OpenGL and C++. The eventual goal of this project is to develop a voxel engine.


## Resources
- The GLAD loader for the version, profile, and extensions for OpenGL that I'm using can be found via this [GLAD Link](http://glad.dav1d.de/#profile=core&api=gl%3D3.3&api=gles1%3Dnone&api=gles2%3Dnone&api=glsc2%3Dnone&extensions=GL_ARB_direct_state_access&extensions=GL_ARB_texture_cube_map_array&extensions=GL_KHR_debug&language=c&specification=gl&loader=on)
- The [Learn OpenGL Website](learnopengl.com) has good tutorials for learning modern OpenGL

## Credits
- Many architectural components were based on or taken from TheCherno's [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) Engine
